# Movie-recommendation-system
A movie recommendation system, also known as a movie recommender system, uses machine learning (ML) to predict or filter users' film preferences based on their prior decisions and actions.
Movie recommendation systems' main objective is to identify and forecast only those films that a corresponding user is most likely to be interested in watching. The user information from the system's database is used by the ML algorithms for these recommendation systems. Based on information from the past, this data is used to forecast the user in question's behaviour in the future.
### Aim of the project
To create a movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques and to create a graphical user interface through which users can access the model and be recommended movies based on their favourite movies.
### Dataset used
The dataset used for this project is called MovieLens 1M Dataset. It contains 1,000,209 anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies 
made by 6,040 MovieLens users who joined MovieLens in 2000.
